    "We can get a little more performance by adding the `fastmath=True` argument, which relaxes the requirement that floating-point operations be performed according to the standard IEEE 754 spec, and can substitute certain functions with faster versions that give the same result within machine precision. One example would be replacing a `x**3.` call with the much-faster `x*x*x`: this is not strictly conformant to what you asked the code to do, but agrees within machine precision. This is usually fine, but **always test your function's accuracy to make sure it calculates the result to desired accuracy**"

    "\n",
    "Numba supports JIT'd object-oriented code via the [jitclass](https://numba.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/jitclass.html?highlight=jitclass). Again, only a subset of the full set of python programming features is available. Crucially, class inheritance is not current supported (last I checked), limiting the power of the approach. Nevertheless, it can still be quite useful to define data containers with associated methods."
